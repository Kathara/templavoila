# Kathara/templavoila
I have forked the master from schnitzler/templavoila. The adaptations I made are the ones that were needed for me to make templavoila work with TYPO3 8.7. It was needed in a project that had to be updated from TYPO3 6.2 to the newest version, and only minimal adaptations led to it working for now. I haven't and will not change anything else in this project but maybe it will be helpful for anyone who has the same problems I had.

## About this version

This version is a fork of the original, abandoned [templavoila/templavoila](https://github.com/templavoila/templavoila) which was made available by a lot of sponsors that supported a crowdfunding campaign. More on that is to be found at [www.templavoila.support](https://www.templavoila.support/).

Once it is installed, you need to run the migration scripts in the TYPO3 install tool to migrate template and data structure icons to FAL. Besides that there are no migrations needed. However, you should have a look at the [documentation](http://docs.templavoila.support/Changelog/7.6/Index.html) and study breaking changes, new features and important information in general.
